Project Title: 	Building a MERN-Stack E-Commerce Website Inspired by Amazon

Project Overview
This project involves developing a functional e-commerce website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) over the course of one week. The goal is to create a simplified version of Amazon's online marketplace, including essential features such as user authentication, product listings, a shopping cart, and basic payment integration. This project will provide hands-on experience in full-stack web development.

Objectives:
Master MERN Stack: Implement a complete web application using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

Develop Core Features: Build user authentication, product management, shopping cart, and order processing.

Implement Security: Ensure secure user authentication and data protection.
Create a Responsive UI: Design a mobile-friendly interface using React.js and Tailwind.

Deploy the Application: Deploy the website for live access if time permits.

Project Timeline (1 Week):

Day 1: Planning and Backend Setup
Project Setup: Initialize the project repository and set up the development environment.
Design Database Schema: Define MongoDB schemas for users, products, and orders.
Backend Structure: Set up the Node.js server with Express.js and connect to MongoDB.

Day 2: Develop Backend APIs
User Authentication: Implement JWT-based user registration, login, and profile management.
Product Management: Create RESTful APIs for product listings, categories, and search functionality.
Order Processing: Develop API endpoints for managing the shopping cart and processing orders.

Day 3: Testing and Finalizing the Backend
Testing APIs: Use Postman to test all backend endpoints for functionality and security.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for API endpoints to manage edge cases and potential issues.

Day 4: Frontend Development - UI Layout
Design Frontend: Create the basic structure and navigation using React.js and Tailwind.
User Authentication Pages: Build the registration and login pages, integrating them with the backend.
Product Display Pages: Develop product listing and detail pages, fetching data from the backend.
Day 5: Frontend Development - Core Features
Shopping Cart Functionality: Implement add-to-cart, view cart, update cart, and remove items features.
Checkout Process: Develop the checkout page, integrating with the backend for order processing.
Payment Integration: Integrate a basic payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal for handling transactions.

Day 6: Final Testing and Integration
Responsive Design Enhancements: Ensure the website is fully responsive across devices.
Full Application Testing: Conduct thorough testing of both frontend and backend, fixing any bugs or issues.
Optimize Performance: Review and optimize code for better performance and user experience.

Day 7: Deployment and Documentation
Deployment: Optionally deploy the website to a platform like Heroku or Netlify for live access.
Documentation: Prepare a project report outlining objectives, features implemented, and challenges faced.

Demo Presentation: Create a short presentation to demonstrate the website’s features.

Expected Outcomes:
By the end of this one-week project, you will have developed a functional e-commerce website inspired by Amazon, utilizing the MERN stack. This project will demonstrate your ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies, manage databases, implement user authentication, and handle basic payment processing.

Deliverables:
Source Code Repository: A GitHub repository containing all source code with documentation.
Live Application: Optionally deployed version of the website.
Project Report: Summary of the project, including objectives, features, challenges, and lessons learned.

Demo Presentation: A brief showcase of the website’s functionalities.

Conclusion:
This project offers a comprehensive learning experience in full-stack web development using the MERN stack. By the end of the week, you will have a working e-commerce platform that demonstrates your ability to build and deploy web applications.
